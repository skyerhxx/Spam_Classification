Yo,

We just want to let you know that we, too, have updated our privacy policy and terms of service. Here's a quick summary of what's changed:

Simplicity

We've cut the clutter in an effort to make the terms simpler for you to read and easier for you to understand.

Transparency

We've made it a great deal more transparent how we collect and use your personal information.

There's no need to act on your end. The updated privacy policy and terms of service will become effective when you access or use Mimo anytime after May 25, 2018.

Mimohello GmbH, Marxergasse 24/2, 1030 Vienna, Austria
